# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Use Pythonâ€™s built-in sum() function to calculate the total
total = sum(numbers)

# Print the result
print("The sum of the list is:", total)

```

## Output:

## Result:
Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list is successfully executed.
