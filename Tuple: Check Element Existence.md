# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## Program
```
# Define a tuple x with some letters and numbers
x = eval(input())

# Use the in operator to check if the string 'n' exists within the tuple
check_n = 'n' in x

# Use the in operator to check if the integer 8 exists within the tuple
check_8 = 8 in x

# Print the results
print("'n' in tuple:", check_n)
print("8 in tuple:", check_8)
```

## Result:
 Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is successfully executed.
